This workshop is set up to be largely language-agnostic (at least with regard to programming language). We will provide examples (as necessary) using `ggplot2` in R and `seaborn` or `matplotlib` in python.

Screenshots will be provided using RStudio as an IDE for both R and Python, but you are free to use any IDE you wish for this workshop.

## Setting Up R, RStudio, and ggplot2

[Start here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) - Instructions for installing R and RStudio for Windows, Mac, and Linux

Open R or RStudio. Follow [these instructions](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to install `ggplot2` (or the whole `tidyverse`, if you prefer).

If you also plan to use python with RStudio, install the `reticulate` package after you have installed python.

## Setting Up Python, Seaborn, and Matplotlib

[Start here](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/install-python) - Instructions for installing Python 3 for Windows, Mac, and Linux

If you wish, install a [development environment](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/data-science-python-ide) such as VSCode or Spyder, or install R and RStudio to use RStudio as an IDE for python. 

Install [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html), which will automatically install matplotlib.

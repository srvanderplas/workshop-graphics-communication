## The Eye

::: notes

Important parts:

- rods and cones - transform light waves into neural signals
  - rods: light intensity (light/dark)
  - cones: light wavelength (color)
- blindspot - region where the optic nerve exits the back of the eye. We don't notice this because our brain compensates.
- fovea - region of mostly cones, highest acuity, but you can't notice e.g. faint stars because you have so many fewer rods in this area. Focusing on a point involves looking at it with your fovea, generally speaking.

## Color Vision

::: notes

Notice that we have better color differentiation in the yellow-green portion of the visual spectrum, compared to red/blue. Sun's light is primarily yellow, most plants are green - this is evolutionary optimization at work. It also is one reason why rainbow color schemes are hard to use - we differentiate different parts of the spectrum with higher resolution, so rainbows don't map to perceptual space well.

## The Brain (Hardware)

- Signals from the retina are integrated - multiple rods combined together
  - Results in optical illusions - Hermann grid, Mach bands

- Feature detectors - parts of the brain that recognize lines at specific angles, in spatial arrays

- Specialized modules for e.g. face detection

- Lots of additional processing -- "software"

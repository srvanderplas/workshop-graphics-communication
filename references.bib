We explored how to present bar charts using a tactile presentation. Our user study used blind participants and evaluated both user preferences and performance. We found that providing grid lines and values in a tactile diagram was preferred to a direct transcription. In addition, presenting the data as a tactile table was preferred to a tactile chart. Both of these approaches reduced the error rate, and presentation as a table had performance benefits. We also investigated the comparative usability of: a tactile presentation, an audio description of the bar chart, and a tactile/audio presentation in which a tactile diagram is overlaid on a touch-sensitive device which provides audio feedback on demand. We found that tactile was the most preferred while audio was the least.},

To explore whether a scatter plot can achieve this goal when it is made in the form of a tactile graph and presented to blind people, we conducted an experiment in which x-y data sets were presented to blind participants in three data representations: tactile graph, tactile table, and electronic table, and the participants were asked to identify the type of relationship between two variables. Under all presentation conditions, the correct rates were high: it was 92.5\% for the tactile graph condition and 85.0\% for the tactile table and electronic table conditions. Tactile graphs were understood with the shortest time, tactile tables with the second shortest, and electronic tables needed the longest time. This differences were due to the different strategies for identifying the relationships. Both tactile graph and tactile table conditions gained higher subjective ratings than the electronic table condition.},

	abstract = {Statistical graphs have been designed for accessible use by visually impaired users. Haptic devices provide an appropriate interface for haptic exploration of statistical graphs. However, haptic exploration of statistical graphs reveals a more local and sequential inspection pattern compared to visual exploration. This difference between haptic exploration and visual exploration is usually attributed to different characteristics of the exploration processes, such as bandwidth of information extraction. To facilitate information extraction from statistical graphs, alternative sensory modalities have been employed. In particular, line graphs have been represented by sound, thus leading to sonified graphs. Despite their demonstrated facilitating effects, sonified graphs have limitations under complex line representations. One method of overcoming those difficulties is to develop a verbal assistance system for haptic line graph comprehension. In the present article, we summarize our studies on designing and developing a verbal assistance system for haptic line graph comprehension. We present the findings in a set of studies conducted with blindfolded and visually impaired participants.},

	abstract = {Visualization techniques such as bar graphs and pie charts let sighted users quickly understand and explore numerical data. These techniques remain by and large inaccessible for visually impaired users. Even when these are made accessible, they remain slow and cumbersome, and not as useful as they might be to sighted users. Previous research has studied two methods of improving perception and speed of navigating auditory graphs - using non-speech audio (such as tones) instead of speech to communicate data and using two audio streams in parallel instead of in series. However, these studies were done in the early 2000s and speech synthesis techniques have improved considerably in recent times, as has the familiarity of visually impaired users with smartphones and speech systems. We systematically compare user performance on four modes that can be used for the generation of auditory graphs: parallel-tone, parallel-speech, serial-tone, and serial-speech. We conducted two within-subjects studies - one with 20 sighted users and the other with 20 visually impaired users. Each user group performed point estimation and point comparison tasks with each technique on two sizes of bar graphs. We assessed task time, errors and user preference. We found that while tone was faster than speech, speech was more accurate than tone. The parallel modality was faster than serial modality and visually impaired users were faster than their sighted counterparts. Further, users showed a strong personal preference towards the serial-speech technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that systematically compares these four techniques.},

Prior research identifies weaknesses of ``rainbow'' colormaps and advocates for ramping in luminance, while recent work contributes multi-hue colormaps generated using perceptually-uniform color models. We contribute a comparative analysis of different colormap types, with a focus on comparing single- and multi-hue schemes. We present a suite of experiments in which subjects perform relative distance judgments among color triplets drawn systematically from each of four single-hue and five multi-hue colormaps. We characterize speed and accuracy across each colormap, and identify conditions that degrade performance. We also find that a combination of perceptual color space and color naming measures more accurately predict user performance than either alone, though the overall accuracy is poor. Based on these results, we distill recommendations on how to design more effective color encodings for scalar data.},

  abstract = {Guidelines for color use in quantitative visualizations have strongly discouraged the use of rainbow colormaps, arguing instead for smooth designs that do not induce visual discontinuities or implicit color categories. However, the empirical evidence behind this argument has been mixed and, at times, even contradictory. In practice, rainbow colormaps are widely used, raising questions about the true utility or dangers of such designs. We study how color categorization impacts the interpretation of scalar fields. We first introduce an approach to detect latent categories in colormaps. We hypothesize that the appearance of color categories in scalar visualizations can be beneficial in that they enhance the perception of certain features, although at the cost of rendering other features less noticeable. In three crowdsourced experiments, we show that observers are more likely to discriminate global, distributional features when viewing colorful scales that induce categorization (e.g., rainbow or diverging schemes). Conversely, when seeing the same data through a less colorful representation, observers are more likely to report localized features defined by small variations in the data. Participants showed awareness of these different affordances, and exhibited bias for exploiting the more discriminating colormap, given a particular feature type. Our results demonstrate costs and benefits for rainbows (and similarly colorful schemes), suggesting that their complementary utility for analyzing scalar data should not be dismissed. In addition to explaining potentially valid uses of rainbow, our study provides actionable guidelines, including on when such designs can be more harmful than useful.

  abstract = {A new hypothesis about the role of focused attention is proposed. The feature-integration theory of attention suggests that attention must be directed serially to each stimulus in a display whenever conjunctions of more than one separable feature are needed to characterize or distinguish the possible objects presented. A number of predictions were tested in a variety of paradigms including visual search, texture segregation, identification and localization, and using both separable dimensions (shape and color) and local elements or parts of figures (lines, curves, etc. in letters) as the features to be integrated into complex wholes. The results were in general consistent with the hypothesis. They offer a new set of criteria for distinguishing separable from integral features and a new rationale for predicting which tasks will show attention limits and which will not. When we open our eyes on a familiar scene, we form an immediate impression of recognizable objects, organized coherently in a spatial framework. Analysis of our experience into more elementary sensations is difficult, and appears subjectively to require an unusual type of perceptual activity. In contrast, the physiological evidence suggests that the visual scene is analyzed at an early stage by specialized populations of receptors that respond selectively to such properties as orientation, color, spatial frequency, or movement, and map these properties in different areas of the brain (Zeki, 1976). The controversy between analytic and synthetic theories of perception goes back many years: the Associationists asserted that the experience of complex wholes is built by combining more elementary sensations, while the Gestalt psychologists claimed that the whole precedes its parts, that we initially register unitary objects and relationships, and only later, if necessary, analyze these objects into their component parts or properties. This view is still active now},

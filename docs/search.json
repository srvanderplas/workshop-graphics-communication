    "text": "Target Audience\nThis course is intended for practicing statisticians in industry, government, or academia who are responsible for communicating results of statistical analyses and data to non-statisticians.\n\nPrerequisites\nAttendees should be able to read data in, clean it, and visualize it using the language of their choice.\nExamples will be provided using ggplot2 code in R and seaborn or matplotlib in python. Instructors can assist students with R and python code during the workshop and will attempt to help with others; we do not promise familiarity with all programming languages in common use for data science."

    "text": "Description\nThis course will focus on strategies for creating data visualizations which make it easy for collaborators to gain insight from data. We will discuss different ways graphics are used during the analysis process, but will primarily focus on graphics used to communicate with non-statisticians: managers, stakeholders, and collaborators who may need to use graphics to make decisions and/or motivate changes. This course will also touch on topics such as accessibility and alt-text that are essential to ensuring that graphics meet regulatory requirements. The course will assume some familiarity with plotting packages such as base R graphics, ggplot2, seaborn, and/or matplotlib, but is not a “how to make graphics” course. Code for different plotting libraries will be provided and modified during the course."

We will discuss color contrast rules, ways to help make graphics accessible to colorblind individuals, those with vision acuity loss, and those who use screen readers.\n\n\n2:30 - 2:45 PM\nBreak\n\n\n\n2:45 - 3:15 PM\nThe Rules… and when to break them\nWe’ve spent the day up to this point discussing tactics for creating good data visualizations, but sometimes, the rules get in the way of effective communication with a specific audience. When is it ok to break these rules?\n\n\n3:15 - 3:30 PM\nBreak\n\n\n\n3:30 - 5:00 PM\nWorkshop: Improving our graphics\nWorking individually or in groups, we will improve existing graphics in order to apply the ideas in this workshop. Individuals can bring their own graphics to workshop or use graphics we’ve provided."
